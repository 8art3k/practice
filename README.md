#Hangman Game
##Project Description
The Hangman  Guessing Game is a simple Python-based program that selects a random fruit from a predefined list. The player tries to guess letters in the word within a limited number of lives. The program checks if the input is a valid single alphabetical character and updates the display of the word as correct letters are guessed. This project aims to introduce basic concepts in Python programming, including random selection, user input validation, conditional logic and classes.

###Key Learning Points:

-Working with lists, random selection and loops in Python.
-Validating user input and handling different cases.
-Using conditional statements for branching logic.
-Understanding object-oriented programming by creating classes and methods
