#Hangman Game
##Project Description
The Hangman  Guessing Game is a simple Python-based program that selects a random fruit from a predefined list and allows the user to guess a letter in that word. The program checks if the input is a valid single alphabetical character and provides feedback accordingly. This project aims to introduce basic concepts in Python programming, including random selection, user input validation, and conditional logic.

###Key Learning Points:

-Working with lists and random selection in Python.
-Validating user input and handling different cases.
-Using conditional statements for branching logic.
